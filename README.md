## Overview

The Wet Lab Calculator simplifies standard experimental calculations used in molecular biology, biochemistry, and general lab workflows.  
It includes tools for reagent preparation, concentration conversions, and dilution adjustments, all accessible through a browser interface.

This repository remains automatically synchronized with your deployed project on [v0.app](https://v0.app).  
Any changes made through the v0 editor are reflected here to ensure version consistency between the app and the repository.

## Deployment

Your live application is hosted on Vercel:  
**[https://vercel.com/victoriadixon-oerthbiocoms-projects/v0-wet-lab-calculator](https://vercel.com/victoriadixon-oerthbiocoms-projects/v0-wet-lab-calculator)**

Deployments are automatically triggered when updates are made through [v0.app](https://v0.app).  
You can also deploy manually by referencing a branch or commit, for example:
